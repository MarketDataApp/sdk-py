## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- `options.chain()` min/max bid/ask price filters are now actually validated (#32)
- `days_to_expiration` filter on `options.chain()` is now sent to the API correctly (was silently ignored) (#30)
- `options.expirations(columns=[...])` no longer returns an empty DataFrame (#23)
- `strike_limit` on `options.chain()` accepts integer values without API rejection (#24)
- `options.quotes()` now exposes `date`, `from`, and `to` params for historical date-range queries (#19)

### Added

- Package root re-exports — `from marketdata import MarketDataClient, MarketDataClientErrorResult, OutputFormat, DateFormat, Mode` (#17)
- `Retry-After` response header is now honored on retries
- API status check now uses the cached `/status` endpoint

### Changed

- Default logging level lowered to WARNING — SDK is quiet by default (#25)
- Retry backoff strategy updated

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-13

- Token obfuscation in logs for security
- Stock candles now accept string input for 'from' and 'to' dates
- Settings model now allows extra environment variables without validation errors
- User agent string is now RFC 7231 compliant
- URL building for /user endpoint

### Added

- `support_info` and `support_context` properties on error results for enhanced debugging
- Improved exception wrapping ensures all errors include support context

### Changed

- Updated logging format and resource lifecycle logging
- Removed /user and /status requests from response logging
- User agent updated to match PyPI package name (marketdata-sdk-py)
